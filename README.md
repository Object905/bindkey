# bindkey
Binds rust functions to keys with xlib

This is a very simple keybinder to functions using xlib.
For now it does not support binding same key with different modifiers (i just dont need it)
Callbacks used as simple functions, to execute it in paralell.

Maybe in the future i will make support for same keys and closures.
